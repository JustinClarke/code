Computers of various sizes and capacities are omnipresent these days. 
They are used for a diverse variety of tasks from medical imaging to gaming. 
A majority of computing applications require the devices to communicate over a computer network.

The first computer network was tested in the late 60s with a few computers. 
Today, the world-wide network of computers (called the Internet) connects more than 5 billion users and has more than 1.5 billion websites!! 
Multimedia applications make up a majority of the data sent over the Internet, with applications such as Youtube, Instagram etc. being favoured by young people.
